# Preview Image Instructions

To add a preview image to your repository:

1. **Take a screenshot** of your running application at http://localhost:5174/
2. **Recommended screenshot settings:**
   - Full browser window showing the application
   - Include the header, filters, and product grid
   - Use a desktop view (1200px+ width) for best results
   - Save as PNG format for best quality

3. **Save the image as `preview.png`** in the root directory
4. **Optimal dimensions:** 1200x800 pixels or similar aspect ratio

## What to capture:
- ✅ CONNECT header with OPTIONAL FEATURE button
- ✅ Search bar with placeholder text
- ✅ Pricing Options filters (Paid, Free, View Only)
- ✅ Product grid showing multiple products
- ✅ Product cards with images, names, and prices
- ✅ Dark theme background

## Alternative:
If you can't take a screenshot right now, you can:
1. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify first
2. Take a screenshot of the live site
3. Add it to the repository later

The README.md already references `./preview.png` so just add the image file.
